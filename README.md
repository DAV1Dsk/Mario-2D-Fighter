2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Game

Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:
```
pgzrun main.py
```

## Controls

## Current Features

- Mario stand animation (3 frames)
- Bowser stand animation (7 frames)
- Peach's Castle background
- Character shadows for better visibility
- Castle-themed health bars (gold for Mario, orange-red for Bowser)
- Basic physics (gravity, ground collision)
- Health bar display for both characters
- Menu system
- Dual character controls (Arrow keys for Mario, WASD for Bowser)

## Development Status

- âœ… Mario stand animation implemented
- âœ… Bowser stand animation implemented
- âœ… Basic physics system
- âœ… Game structure
- âœ… Dual character controls
- âœ… Peach's Castle background
- ðŸ”„ Sprite transparency (blue background removal needed)

## Notes

**Sprite Background Issue**: The Mario and Bowser sprites currently have blue backgrounds that may clash with the castle background. To fix this:
1. Open the sprite images in an image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Select the blue background areas
3. Make them transparent
4. Save as PNG with transparency
